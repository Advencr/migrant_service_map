            <summary>What is the Migrant Service Map?</summary>
            <p>The Migrant Service Map is an interactive mapping tool designed to streamline common workflows for service providers who assist immigrant communities.  It helps providers locate organizations in Boston – such as community centers, education resources, legal and healthcare assistance – and share these with their clients.</p>
            <p>Built in 2019, the map is a result of Refugee’s Welcome!’s ongoing research into methods to improve immigrant service provision.  Development has been a joint effort between Refugees Welcome!, the MapBox Community Development Office, and Code for Boston.</p>
